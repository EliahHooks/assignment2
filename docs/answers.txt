    git log -1 -- README.md

(Question 4):

    Branches are used in a git repository 1)so that work can be done on a feature while not affecting the main code and 2)because
    it allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.

(Question 5):

    git log lists the comment history of each branch while git status displays the status of your working directory.

(Question 6):

    git log -- Vehicle.h

(Question 7):
    git log --grep="file"

(Question 8):

    I: Inheritance is an OOP principle that states that allows a subclass to inherit the properties and functions of the parent class.
    II: Polymorphism is an OOP principle that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
    III: Encapsulation is an OOP principle that allows bundling the attributes and functions that operate on the data into a single unit. 

(Question 9):
    The main difference in the two workflows is the way the code is integrated. In the integration manager workflow, the integration
    manager makes the final decisions while in the "Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow the dictator integrates the changes from the
    lieutenants.

(Question 10):

    A team of 100 developers would benefit from the "Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow by increasing the efficiency.
    The "Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow would make the process more organized and reduce potential conflicts.
